Hi, my name is Aeneas. I have lived in the great city of Troy, but it has fallen under the attacks of babarious Greek army. Unlike most of the poeple in the city, I have escaped the city by night, carrying my lame father on my shoulder, my wife and kids following behind. 

They were running towards the forest in order to escape the hunt from Greek amry. After several time, they were exhausted and had to take a rest. 
When they looked backward, they found out a huge Trojan Horse moving towards him. 

"Oh my gosh, how could it find us?" I couldn't help but ask. 

Beyond their knowledge, they had no idea that Trojan Horse was already equipped with artificial intelligence. 

I said to my family, "run and don't look back when things get ugly. Kids, take care of your mother and my father. You are going to take care of this family now".

As the Trojan Horse approaching, crushing every thing as it went by, my wife came up with a brilliant idea that could save everyone from the situation.
